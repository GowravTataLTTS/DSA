For slicing the elements in the list, list has specified in the following manner

list[inclusive_index:exclusive_index]

Ex: a = [1,2,3,4,5]

for a[1:4], it starts with 2 and goes up to 4 , 5 is not displayed as it is in the 4th index which is excluded
from the indexing


a= [1,2,3,4,5]
a2=a[:]
whenever a new list is made from a existing it always gives a different list from the original list
meaning the address or memory block of the copied list is different from the original list

In case of tuple & string, the copy and original refer to the same address or memory block, because they are
immutable.
