A function calling itself is called recursion

Backtracking is used in

1. Dynamic Programming
2. Backtracking
3. Divide & Conquer(Binary Search,Quick Sort, Merge Sort)

4. Tower of hanoi
5. DFS

Tail Recursion: while using recursion , if there is no line after the recursion it is called tail recursion

Tail Call Elimination: Using of certain keywords  in languages like java , they eliminate the usage of recursion
function. instead of that they use keywords like 'goto', 'start'.

In python tail recursion can be changed into a loop

Quicksort, Postorder Tree Traversal are tail recursive
